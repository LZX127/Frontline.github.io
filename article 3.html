   <h1 style="font-family:tahoma;font-size:56">How to Spot Information Disorder
</h1>
     
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Information disorder is a complicated issue. Some of it is low-level information pollution — clickbait headlines, poor captions, and false satire — but some of it is clever and deceitful. The language we employ is important for understanding, explaining, and addressing these issues. Definitions and terminology are important. As this guide has shown, there are several examples of how material may be used to frame, deceive, and manipulate people. Breaking out these strategies rather than perceiving them as one will improve your newsroom and give your viewers a better understanding of the difficulties we face today.
In this site we will provide some information on how to spot disinformation in order. </p>
  <br><br/>
<ul style="font-family:tahoma;fontsize:14">
  <li><strong style="font-weight:600">1. Check the Source</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission and its contact info.</p>
  <li><strong style="font-weight:600">2. Read Beyond</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What's the whole story?</p>
    <li><strong style="font-weight:600">3. Check the Author</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?</p>
  <li><strong style="font-weight:600">4. Supporting Sources</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Click on those links. Determine if the info given actually supports the story.</p>
    <li><strong style="font-weight:600">5. Check the Date</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Reposting old news stories doesn't mean they're relevant to current events.</p>
  <li><strong style="font-weight:600">6. Is it a Source Joke?</strong></li>
  <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">If it is too outlandish, it might be satire. Research the site and author to be sure.</p>
</ul>  
<br></br>
   <h3 style="font-family:tahoma;font-size:26">Fact Checking </h3>
   <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">The news headlines from all across the world might be frightening. They hope to elicit emotional responses from customers. It might be tough to tell what is true and what is misleading in an age where information spreads so rapidly.<p/>
     <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">With just a few keystrokes, billions of individuals can access information on the internet. It also makes it simple to distribute false information, which may have terrible consequences for both individuals and society. As a result, it's critical to double-check information sources.<p/>
     <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">The best way to counter fake news is to conduct your own research. Through this guide, you’ll learn the basics about misinformation and fake news, how to evaluate sources of information, where to find reputable information, and where to look for fact-checking tools.<p/>
   <h3 style="font-family:tahoma;font-size:26">Verifying User-Generated Content (UGC) </h3>
      <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"><strong style="font-weight:900">1. Who’s behind the information?</strong><p/>
       <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">Visit the page for  7 Types of Mis-/Disinformation. One of the types in the list is called Imposter Content, which is basically false and misleading content circulated by imposter accounts. To filter imposter content, you must always verify people’s identity -- if they are who they say they are online. The most commonly faked accounts are those of journalists, news organizations, politicians, and celebrities. Aside from imposter accounts, you should also be wary of internet<strong> trolls</strong> (someone who makes intentionally inflammatory, rude, or upsetting statements online to elicit strong emotional responses from people or to steer the conversation to a different direction) and <strong>bots</strong> (internet robots; software programs that perform automated, repetitive, predefined tasks). <p/>
        <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14">TThese are social media profiles that make rude and confrontational comments online with the goal of provoking strong emotional responses. Often, these accounts are fake and are produced in thousands to millions inside so-called<strong> ‘troll farms’</strong>. It is becoming more and more difficult to detect trolls as their profiles are created to be more unique and sophisticated. But one strategy that remains effective is to locate the original uploader of a content and evaluate whether a piece of false content is spread in a coordinated manner through trolls (i.e. Are the posts copy-pasted, or do they follow a certain script?)<p/>
              <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"><strong style="font-weight:900">2. Is the content authentic?</strong><p/>
         <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"> It is no secret anymore how easy it is to make a fake photo, video, tweet, or document. And yet, people are still so quick to fall for anything that captures their attention. Manipulated content (genuine information or imagery that is edited to deceive) and fabricated content (new content that is 100% false and designed to deceive and do harm) about coronavirus are uploaded in hundreds or even thousands online every day. <p/>
        <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"> One important skill you must learn in testing the authenticity of an online content is using Reverse Image Search through Tineye. This technique allows you to check if an image is being recycled to support a new claim or event. By checking one or more image databases (with billions of images), you can track where an image has appeared elsewhere in the internet. Take note: If a reverse image search does not show you results, it does not automatically prove that the image is original; you still need to do additional checks. <p/>
      <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"><strong style="font-weight:900">3. What do other sources say? </strong><p/>
         <p style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:14"> Lateral reading is the process of finding multiple sources to either confirm or disprove a piece of information. When online, you do this by opening a new tab and searching for keywords to find out. This is opposed to ‘vertical reading’ which means staying on a webpage to look for information and evidence. When Googling, remember, the top result is not always the best and most credible result. Take the time to scan different results and open multiple tabs.
